##  How to Run Locally

### Using Docker (Recommended)

```bash
docker-compose up
```

- **Backend:** [http://localhost:5000/health](http://localhost:5000/health)
- **Frontend:** Open the file `index.html` in your browser (located at `backend/frontend/index.html`)

## Health Endpoint Sample Output

```json
{
  "cpu": "13%",
  "ram": "47%",
  "disk": "62%",
  "time": "2025-05-29 15:44:01"
}
```

---

## GitHub Actions CI

- Auto-runs on push to the `main` branch
- Verifies the `/health` endpoint is working using `curl`
- Ensures backend boots and responds properly

---

##  Next Steps

- Add live charts with Chart.js
- Deploy the project on platforms like Render or Railway
- Improve the UI and add auto-refresh functionality
